//This is the code that i showed during our meeting. To wire the driver for the acctuator to the arduino, 
//attach one of the - terminals of the driver to a GND pin on the arduino.
//Then attach the RC pin of the driver to pin 9 of the arduino. Then connect the other - terminal and the + terminal of the driver to a 12V supply. 
//There is an ac to 12VDC wall converter in one of our boxes. This works fine. 
//To use the code, first upload it to the baord then go to tools and select serial monitor. 
//from the serial monitor you can type what position you want the acctuator to go to.
